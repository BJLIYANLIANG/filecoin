## Key Filecoin Project resources

The [Filecoin Project on GitHub](https://github.com/filecoin-project) is where you can find our active work. Sometimes we use Google Drive for work products (usually design docs and priorities lists). In these instances, we will either translate these docs to Markdown and post on GitHub or make them public and link to them from the relevant GitHub repos. So, you can generally keep track of the Filecoin Project's work by following us on GitHub.

Here are the main Filecoin Project repos:
- [`specs`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/specs): This is the home of the WIP Filecoin protocol specification
- [`go-filecoin`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-filecoin): An implementation of the Filecoin protocol, written in Go
- [`rust-proofs`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/rust-proofs): Implementations of Filecoin cryptographic proofs, written in Rust
- [`research`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/research): Where open problems in Filecoin research are discussed
- [`designdocs`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/designdocs): Contains links to our key design docs
- [`community`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community): Resources for community calls and pointers to main communication channels

## Reporting security vulnerabilities

Almost anything you find that is a bug in the codebase should be filed as an issue. The exception is if you find a security vulnerability. The Filecoin protocol is still under heavy development. This means that there may be problems in our protocol design or implementations. Though Filecoin is not yet production-ready, many people are already running nodes on their machines. So we take security vulnerabilities very seriously! If you discover a security issue, please bring it to our attention right away!

If you find a security vulnerability, please send your report privately to security@filecoin.org. Please DO NOT file a public issue.

If the issue is a protocol weakness that cannot be immediately exploited or has not yet been deployed, just discuss it openly.
